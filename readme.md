Do you have a 2 in 1 for content consumption and want to watch while lying down and dont want to watch in portrait mode.

i sure am so i made my own auto rotation based on the dell xps 2 in 1.

it can 
 - to auto detect when keyboard is rotated so system will allways flip upside down in tent mode 
 - be disabled when windows rotation lock is disabled so you can go into portrait mode.
